1. **Building Scheme and Evaluation:** I already have a building scheme evaluated in my memory (extents_x=30, extents_y=40, grid_spacing_x=6, grid_spacing_y=6, no_of_floors=4). I will reuse the evaluation results.       

2. **Find "Structural Steel (100% Recycled Scrap)" product:** I'll use the `search_2050_products` tool to find the product.

3. **Multiply manufacturing emissions with steel tonnage:** Once I have the product details (specifically, manufacturing emissions) and the steel tonnage from the building scheme evaluation, I'll use the `multiply` tool 
to perform the calculation.

4. **Find sustainable building materials:** I'll use the `search_documents` tool to find examples of sustainable building materials.

5. **Report the final answer:** Finally, I will compile all the information (building scheme, evaluation, multiplication result, and sustainable materials) into a single, structured `FINAL_ANSWER`.

Let's start by searching for the "Structural Steel (100% Recycled Scrap)" product.

2.  I also have the manufacturing emissions value of the steel product "Structural Steel (100% Recycled Scrap)" which is 0.513.
3.  Next, I need to multiply the manufacturing emissions value (0.513) with the steel tonnage value (450.5).
4.  Then I need to find some examples of sustainable building materials from the uploaded documents.
5.  Finally, report the building scheme, the evaluation, the result of the multiplication, and the list of building materials.

[19:37:51] [plan] LLM output: Okay, I understand the problem. The user wants me to generate a building scheme, evaluate it, find a specific steel product, multiply its manufacturing emissions with the building's steel tonnage, find sustainable building materials examples from documents, and then present all this information in a final answer.

I have already performed the following actions:
1. Generated and evaluated a building scheme.
2. Found the "Structural Steel (100% Recycled Scrap)" product and its manufacturing emissions.
3. Multiplied the manufacturing emissions by the steel tonnage.
4. Searched for examples of sustainable building materials from the documents.

Now, I need to collect all the information and present the final answer.

Here's the information I have:

*   **Building Scheme:**
    *   extents\_x: 30
    *   extents\_y: 40
    *   grid\_spacing\_x: 6
    *   grid\_spacing\_y: 6
    *   no\_of\_floors: 4
*   **Evaluation:**
    *   steel\_tonnage: 450.5
    *   column\_size: 400
    *   structural\_depth: 600
    *   concrete\_tonnage: 2500.75
    *   trustworthy: true
*   **Steel Product:** Structural Steel (100% Recycled Scrap)
    *   manufacturing\_emissions: 0.513 kg/kg
*   **Multiplication Result:** 231.1065
*   **Sustainable Building Materials (from documents):**
    *   Low VOC and lead-free interior paints
    *   Granite, vitrified tiles, and kota stone
    *   Ceramic tiles, vitrified tiles, and kota stone
    *   Pozzolana Portland cement with 35% flyash content and gypsum
    *   AAC blocks

Now, I will consolidate this information into the final answer.
