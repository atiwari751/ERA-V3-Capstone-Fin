[22:35:41] [plan] LLM output: Okay, I need to generate 3 distinct and diverse building schemes and evaluate them using the `ai_form_schemer` tool.

Here's my plan:
1. Generate the parameters for the first building scheme.
2. Evaluate the first scheme using `ai_form_schemer`.
3. Generate the parameters for the second building scheme, ensuring it is distinct from the first.
4. Evaluate the second scheme using `ai_form_schemer`.
5. Generate the parameters for the third building scheme, ensuring it is distinct from the first two.
6. Evaluate the third scheme using `ai_form_schemer`.
7. Present the results in the final answer.

Let's start with the first scheme. I'll choose some initial parameters:
- grid_spacing_x: 6
- grid_spacing_y: 7
- extents_x: 30
- extents_y: 42
- no_of_floors: 5

Now, I will evaluate this scheme.
