[23:16:32] [plan] LLM output: Okay, I need to generate a building scheme and evaluate it using the `ai_form_schemer` tool. Then, I need to report the scheme parameters and the evaluation results as the final answer.

Here's my plan:

1.  Choose some initial values for the building scheme parameters: `grid_spacing_x`, `grid_spacing_y`, `extents_x`, `extents_y`, and `no_of_floors`.
2.  Use the `ai_form_schemer` tool to evaluate the building scheme.
3.  Report the scheme parameters and the evaluation results.

Let's start by choosing the following scheme parameters:

*   `grid_spacing_x`: 8 meters
*   `grid_spacing_y`: 8 meters
*   `extents_x`: 40 meters
*   `extents_y`: 40 meters
*   `no_of_floors`: 5

Now, I will use the `ai_form_schemer` tool to evaluate this scheme.

I have also found the product "Structural Steel (100% Recycled Scrap)" and its manufacturing emissions value. Now, I need to multiply the manufacturing emissions of the steel product with the steel tonnage of the building scheme. Finally, I need to extract examples of sustainable building materials from the uploaded documents and report the final answer with all the required information.

I will now multiply the manufacturing emissions with the steel tonnage.
